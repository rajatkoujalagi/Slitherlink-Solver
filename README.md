Slitherlink-Solver
==================

This project deals with creating a program that solves Slitherlink (http://www.puzzle-loop.com/)

Aim of the first part of the project to develop a program that plays with no intelligence, that is it allows humans to make moves and check if the game has been won.

The second program generates a solution for a particular board. For small boards, a blind search(DFS) is performed to seach for a solution. For larger boards, the starting techniques of (http://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/slitherlink/techniques) are applied and then a solution is generated.
